# precommit

This terraform module utilised [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). You can install the git hooks locally to aid you with ensuring that the terraform module complies with our linting, formatting, security and validation policies. Once pre-commit is installed on you development machine you can run:

``` bash
$ pre-commit install
$ pre-commit run --all-files
$
```

The checks will also be performed automatically by pre-commit when attempting to git commit.
